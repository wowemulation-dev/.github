# Contributing to WoW Emulation projects

Generally speaking, any kind of contribution is welcome. We do not expect
you to be a professional engineer knowing all the tricks and bringing
decades of experience and knowledge to the table.

The team members are people who want to keep on enjoying an old game,
and we are learning along the way as we publish our projects.

Some of our projects may provide invidivual requirements for contributions,
so please check first there.

Keep in mind that we can not guarantee instant replies to discussions, issues
or pull requests. Our team members mostly are active on weekends, and as such
any submission should be reviewed and/or reacted to at least on a weekly
schedule.

## Issues

Each individual project provides templates for bug reports and feature
requests. When submitting an issue, please fill out the templates accordingly.

Take some time to describe the nature of your issue, and helps to the best of
your abilities to understand how we can help you.

A reviewer will always be assigned from the pool of project contributors.

## Pull Requests

When submitting pull requests, we generally do not set any requirements.
A good, concise description helps, and in case contributing code we would
appreciate a few hints how to verify the functionality of the submitted
changes.

Each pull request will be reviewed by an existing contributor.

## Git Commit Messages

Commit messages are the single most important place to help other community
members to understand what you are proposing, thus we ask to take a bit of
time when writing yours.

We recommend to use [Conventional Commits][], as it allows to provide
sufficient context and sets some ground rules for how to author messages.
