## 🤗 Who We Are

We're just gamers who want to keep enjoying the games we love, learning and growing
together along the way. Nobody here knows everything, and that's what makes it fun!

## 💬 Git Commit Messages Made Easy

We use [Conventional Commits][] - it's simpler than it sounds! Here are examples:

### The Basics 📚

- `feat:` Adding something new
  - Example: `feat: add dark mode toggle to settings`
- `fix:` Fixing a bug
  - Example: `fix: correct database connection timeout`
- `docs:` Documentation changes
  - Example: `docs: update installation instructions`
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks
  - Example: `chore: update dependencies`

### Pro Tips 💡

- Keep it short and sweet (under 50 characters)
- Use present tense ("add" not "added")
- No period at the end
- Explain the "why" in the PR description

**Messed up a commit message? It happens to all of us! We can fix it together! 🤝**
