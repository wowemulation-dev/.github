# Wow Emulation Project Support Guidelines

We strongly believe in open discourse, and community connections. Thus by
default [GitHub discussions][] are the first place you should head to for
support.

## GitHub Discussions

You will find announcements and other community members using one or many
of our projects there. The **WoW Emulation** team will generally post
any news about the project and all of the invidiual projects we publish
there and we read and answer posts there.

Before you open a discussion, please make sure you peruse the available
project documentation. If we have not documented what you are looking for
or in case it's not sufficiently helpful, we are happy to see suggestions
or requests for improvements in the discussions.

## GitHub Issues

Each of our repositories is open for filing issues for bugs and feature
requests. Each repository provides dedicated templates for both cases.
Please make use of these templates, as it lets us process incoming bug
reports and feature requests faster.

When filing issues remember there will be a human being sitting on the
other side to read and help. A little kindness, effort and patience go
a long way to get results for your request.
