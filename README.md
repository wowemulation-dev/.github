This is a special place, where we provide a first look into the WoW Emulation
community. While the project will not see much activity, it is the first thing
shown to you on the [wowemulation-dev][] GitHub profile to guide you into our
community.

If you want to see the profile for the `wowemulation-dev` community, you can
read it in [`profile/README.md`](profile/README.md). Should you see anything we
could improve on our public profile, feel free to submit a pull request or
submit an issue.

For further documentation on what this can be used for, check out the GitHub
[community][] documentation.
