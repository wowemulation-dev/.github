This is a special place, where we provide a first look into the WoW Emulation
community. While it will not be commonly used much, it is the first thing you
see on the [wowemulation-dev](https://github.com/wowemulation-dev) profile.

For further documentation on what this can be used for, check out the GitHub
[community](https://docs.github.com/en/communities) documentation.

If you just want to see the profile for the `wowemulation-dev` community, you
can read it in [`profile/README.md`](profile/README.md). Should you see any
opportunity for improving our public profile, feel free to submit a pull request.
