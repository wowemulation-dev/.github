# Licensing 📜

## Dual License - Your Choice! 🎯

The WoW Emulation community believes in giving you flexibility. All projects under
our organization are dual-licensed, meaning you can choose the license that works
best for your needs:

- **MIT License** - Simple and permissive
- **Apache License 2.0** - Patent protection included

## 🤝 Why Dual Licensing?

We want our code to be as useful as possible to the community! By offering both licenses:

- **MIT** lovers get the simplicity they prefer
- **Apache 2.0** users get explicit patent grants
- Everyone can contribute and use our code with confidence

## 📋 How to Choose

### Choose MIT if you want

- ✨ Maximum simplicity
- 📝 Minimal requirements
- 🚀 Quick integration

### Choose Apache 2.0 if you want

- 🛡️ Patent protection
- 📜 Clear contribution terms
- 🏢 Enterprise-friendly licensing

## 📄 License Files

- [`LICENSE-MIT`](LICENSE-MIT) - The MIT License text
- [`LICENSE-APACHE`](LICENSE-APACHE) - The Apache License 2.0 text

## 💡 Using Our Code

When using code from WoW Emulation projects, you can choose either license. Simply
include the appropriate license file and follow its terms.

### Example License Header

```text
// This file is dual-licensed under MIT OR Apache-2.0
