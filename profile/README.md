[WoW Emulation][] is a warm, beginner-friendly community that's been growing
since August 2023. We're here for anyone interested in experiencing the classic
versions of [World of Warcraft][] that captured our hearts.

## 🎮 What We're About

We preserve and support World of Warcraft, with a primary focus on **WoW
Classic** and archival support for original releases.

### Classic Releases ([CASC Archive Format with NGDP][cascette-rs]) ✨

These are our primary focus - the modern Classic recreations that let players
experience WoW as it was:

- ⚔️ **Classic Era** (1.13.x, 1.14.x, 1.15.x) - Recreation of Vanilla
- 🔥 **Burning Crusade Classic** (2.5.x) - Recreation of TBC
- ❄️ **Wrath Classic** (3.4.x) - Recreation of WotLK
- 🌋 **Cataclysm Classic** (4.4.x) - Recreation of Cataclysm
- 🐼 **Mists of Pandaria Remix** (5.5.x) - Recreation of MoP

These Classic versions use the [CASC archive format and Blizzard's NGDP
content distribution pipeline][cascette-rs]. We're building a replacement for
the Battle.net client that works with modern WoW Classic clients - it's almost
complete!

### Original Releases ([MPQ Archive Format][warcraft-rs])

These older versions are supported for archival purposes:

- ⚔️ **Vanilla** (1.x) - Where it all began
- 🔥 **The Burning Crusade** (2.x) - Through the Dark Portal
- ❄️ **Wrath of the Lich King** (3.x) - Face the Frozen Throne
- 🌋 **Cataclysm** (4.x) - When the world shattered
- 🐼 **Mists of Pandaria** (5.x) - Discover Pandaria's mysteries

These original versions use [MPQ archives][warcraft-rs] for game data storage.
