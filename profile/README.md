## 🎮 What We're About

We preserve and support World of Warcraft from its earliest days through Mists of
Pandaria, including both original and Classic releases:

### Original Releases ([MPQ Archive Format][warcraft-rs])
- ⚔️ **Vanilla** (1.x) - Where it all began
- 🔥 **The Burning Crusade** (2.x) - Through the Dark Portal
- ❄️ **Wrath of the Lich King** (3.x) - Face the Frozen Throne
- 🌋 **Cataclysm** (4.x) - When the world shattered
- 🐼 **Mists of Pandaria** (5.x) - Discover Pandaria's mysteries

These original versions use [MPQ archives][warcraft-rs] for game data storage.

### Classic Releases ([CASC Archive Format with NGDP][cascette-rs])
- ⚔️ **Classic Era** (1.13.x, 1.14.x, 1.15.x) - Recreation of Vanilla
- 🔥 **Burning Crusade Classic** (2.5.x) - Recreation of TBC
- ❄️ **Wrath Classic** (3.4.x) - Recreation of WotLK
- 🌋 **Cataclysm Classic** (4.4.x) - Recreation of Cataclysm
- 🐼 **Mists of Pandaria Remix** (5.5.x) - Recreation of MoP

These Classic versions use the [CASC archive format and Blizzard's NGDP content
distribution pipeline][cascette-rs].

Together, we develop software and tools that let anyone experience these games
using the original client software, working with both [MPQ][warcraft-rs] and [CASC][cascette-rs] archive formats.

It's all about preserving gaming history! 📚
