# What is WoW Emulation?

[WoW Emulation][] is a new beginner-friendly community in the making since
August 2023 for anyone interested in experiencing older, now defunct releases
of [World of Warcraft][].

Our focus are the initial releases from the vanilla version in 2004, the first
expansion **The Burning Crusade** and the second expansion
**Wrath of the Lich King**.

In our community we develop software and tooling allowing anyone to experience
the original game, using the original client software.

Our community does not support the [Classic WoW][] releases, as we do not
intend to interfer with [Blizzard][] providing a more modern experience of the
old game. Instead, our focus is on archival, and enabling the wider community
to keep the old game alive and a most wonderful experience for young and old
alike.

## Support

- 🗨️ [community discussions][] are open at all times
- 📫 you can reach us via [mail][] if you require direct assistance
- 👨‍💼 [@danielsreichenbach][] is currently the primary caretaker
- 🌱 since the seeds to grow this community were just planted in August 2023,
  we kindly request to have a little patience with us while we bootstrap things

## Joining us

We are looking 👀 to grow our community and welcome anyone with a solid
interest in old, now defunct World of Warcraft releases. Since we are merely
a newborn, a wide range of options is available

- a community manager helping us to turn this place into a warm, welcoming
  environment
- fresh developers looking to make their mark in the world
- season engineers knowing how to scale up big
- testers, users, generally anyone providing feedback and willing to share
  their expectations
