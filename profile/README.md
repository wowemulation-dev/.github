# What is WoW Emulation?

[WoW Emulation](https://wowemulation.dev/) is a new beginner-friendly community
in the making since August 2023 for anyone interested in experiencing older,
now defunct releases of [World of Warcraft](https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/).

Our focus are the initial releases from the vanilla version in 2004, the first
expansion **The Burning Crusade** and the second expansion **Wrath of the Lich King**.

In our community we develop software and tooling allowing anyone to experience
the original game, using the original client software.

Our community does not support the [Classic WoW](https://wowclassic.blizzard.com/)
releases, as we do not intend to interfer with [Blizzard](https://blizzard.com)
providing a more modern experience of the old game. Instead, our focus is on
archival, and enabling the wider community to keep the old game alive and a most
wonderful experience for young and old alike.
