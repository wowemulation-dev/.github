# Welcome to WoW Emulation! 🎉

**First time here? You're in the right place! No question is too small! 💚**

[WoW Emulation][] is a warm, beginner-friendly community that's been growing since
August 2023. We're here for anyone interested in experiencing the classic versions
of [World of Warcraft][] that captured our hearts.

## 🎮 What We're About

We focus on three beloved expansions:

- ⚔️ **Vanilla** (2004) - Where it all began
- 🔥 **The Burning Crusade** - Through the Dark Portal
- ❄️ **Wrath of the Lich King** - Face the Frozen Throne

Together, we develop software and tools that let anyone experience these
original games using the original client software. It's all about preserving
gaming history! 📚

## 🤝 Our Mission

We're not here to compete with [Classic WoW][] - [Blizzard][] does their thing,
and we do ours! Our focus is on:

- 🏛️ **Archival** - Preserving gaming history

- 🎓 **Learning** - Growing our skills while having fun
- 💖 **Inclusivity** - Creating wonderful experiences for everyone
