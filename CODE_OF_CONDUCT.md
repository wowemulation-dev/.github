## 🤝 Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## ✨ Our Standards - How We Roll

### 💚 The Good Stuff - What Makes Our Community Awesome

These behaviors make everyone smile:

- 🤗 **Being kind and empathetic** - "Hey, I've been there too!"
- 🌈 **Respecting different perspectives** - "That's an interesting approach!"
- 💭 **Sharing helpful feedback** - "Have you tried X? It worked great for me!"
- 🙏 **Owning our mistakes** - "My bad! Here's how I'll fix it."
- 🎯 **Thinking of the community** - "How can we make this better for everyone?"
- 🎉 **Celebrating others' successes** - "Awesome PR! Welcome to the team!"
- 🧑‍🏫 **Teaching and mentoring** - "Let me show you a cool trick!"
- 🤝 **Being patient with beginners** - "We all started somewhere!"

### 🚫 The Not-So-Good Stuff - What We Don't Do Here

These behaviors hurt our community:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## 🛡️ Keeping Everyone Safe - Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## 🌍 Where This Applies - Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## 📬 How to Report Issues - Enforcement

**See something? Say something! We've got your back! 💪**

If someone's making you or others uncomfortable:

- 🤐 **Your privacy is sacred** - We'll never share your details
- ⚡ **We'll act quickly** - Usually within 48 hours
- 🤝 **We'll be fair** - Everyone gets heard

**Remember: Reporting helps keep our community awesome! You're not "causing drama" - you're protecting our family! 🏡**
